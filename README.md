# Module-9-SQL-Challenge
This challenge is for a research project about people employed by the fictional company Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. The challenge involves designing tables to hold the data from the CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answering questions about the data.
The challenge encompasses performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
The six CSV files were uploaded into tables that were part of a database accessed through pg Admin 4.
Eight queries were run; screenshots of results are added to the images file.
A .png of the diagram of the ERD created through Quick DBD is also in the image file.
Instructor Steven Green assisted with question on foreign key and sequencing of tables; ASK BCS query #271607 with Luna Zhang2 assisted with proper structure of foreign keys in pgAdmin. A GitHub file from shreymukh provided the final clue on how to structure the date query within the year column for the 1986 ask.
