# Module-9-SQL-Challenge
This challenge is for a research project about people employed by the fictional company Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s.
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. The challenge involves designing tables to hold the data from the CSV files, importing the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answering questions about the data.
The challenge encompasses performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
